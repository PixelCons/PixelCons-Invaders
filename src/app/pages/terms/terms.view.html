		PixelCon Invaders is a generative art platform for unique tokenized minimalistic pixel art that can be created, transferred, and owned by users through the Ethereum and Optimistic Ethereum networks using specially developed smart contracts (the “Smart Contracts”). A user interface is provided in the form of a website (the “Site”). Using the combined Site and Smart Contracts (the “Service”), users can view their PixelCon Invaders as well as create, trade, and sell them. Please read these Terms of Use ("Terms", "Terms of Use") carefully before using the Service operated by PixelCons ("us", "we", or "our").
		<br/><br/>
		Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.
		<br/><br/>
		By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service. This Terms of Service agreement for PixelCon Invaders was generated in part by [the Terms and Conditions Generator] (https://termsfeed.com/terms-conditions/generator/).

		<br/>
		In order to to use the Service, you must first have a web browser with a web3 provider installed on your device. This includes several mobile Ethereum wallet apps or a desktop browser like FireFox or Google Chrome, with an extension called MetaMask installed. The apps or browser extensions provide an electronic wallet which is required for you to interact with the Smart Contracts. The Service will not recognize you as a user until you are accessing it with a web3 provider. This is the only way to use the Service beyond a read only interface.
		<br/><br/>
		You are responsible for the security of your electronic wallet. Our Service may contain links to third-party web sites or services that are not owned or controlled by Us including the mentioned web3 providers. We have no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party websites or services. You further acknowledge and agree that We shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such websites or services. This includes third parties that may also interact with the Smart Contracts.
		<br/><br/>
		All transactions with the Service are managed by the Ethereum blockchain, which require as small free to process them (a “Gas Fee”). You are expected to pay this fee to help fund the network of decentralized computers that make up Ethereum. You also understand that transactions on the Ethereum blockchain are public, meaning your Ethereum public address will be seen publicly interacting with the Smart Contracts.
		<br/><br/>
		You will be solely responsible to pay any and all sales, use, value-added and other taxes, duties, and assessments (except taxes on our net income) now or hereafter claimed or imposed by any governmental authority (collectively, “Taxes”) associated with your use of the Service (including, without limitation, any Taxes that may become payable as the result of your ownership, transfer, or creation of any of your PixelCon Invaders).
		<br/><br/>
		You agree and understand that the Service is only a platform. This means you are responsible for your own conduct and consequences while using the Service. This includes but is not limited to, creating, trading or naming a PixelCon or content that is considered unlawful, defamatory, harassing, abusive, fraudulent, obscene, or otherwise objectionable. You also agree not to do anything malicious in nature, including but not limited to, distributing viruses, misinformation, or anything deceptive in nature. This especially includes creating content in the Service that infringes on the intellectual proprietary rights of any party.
		<br/><br/>
		As a platform, the Service also does not guarantee any safety during use. This includes, but is not limited to, preventing exposure to content that may be deemed inappropriate. The Service provides no sort of filter for hiding content that may be seen as offensive. The Service can be thought of as a web browser for the content created on the Smart Contracts by its users. 
		<br/><br/>
		<div class="textLarge textBold textDark">The PixelCons Core Contract</div>
		<br/>
		The Service utilizes a single Smart Contract (the “Core Contract”) for maintaining the platform core state, including ownership and creation of PixelCons. You understand and have reviewed the functions defined in the Core Contract (<a class="light textDark textBold" href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x5536b6aadd29eaf0db112bb28046a5fad3761bd4#code">source code</a>). We do not possess any special control or abilities for interacting with this Smart Contract beyond the public user functions with the exception of the three admin functions described below.
		<br/>
		<ol type="1">
			<li>We retain the ability to withdraw any ether transferred to the Core Contract. There are no required value amounts to execute any of the Core Contract functions, so any ether sent to the Core Contract is strictly volunteered. We are not responsible for returning any ether sent to the Core Contract intentionally or otherwise.</li>
			<li>We retain the ability to set the metadata URI link in the Core Contract. This allows Us to provide a reliable reference for third party websites to read PixelCon metadata. All meta data for a PixelCon can be obtained through secondary functions in the Core Contract.</li>
			<li>We retain the ability to transfer admin control to another Ethereum address.</li>
		</ol>
		You can freely create, modify and transfer ownership of PixelCons at your own discretion. To create a PixelCon, it must simply be unique, meaning it is not currently owned by another user. You can also group PixelCons you create and currently own into collections (a “Collection”). When creating a PixelCon or collection you will have the option of giving it a name for other users to see and help them search for it. If you elect to interact with the Core Contract, you understand that all transactions are facilitated through the Ethereum network, which We do not have any special insight or control over. This means We are not liable to you or to any third party for claims or damages that result from these interactions.
		<br/><br/>
		Additionally, the Core Contract implements the ERC-721 specification for non-fungible tokens. This means that PixelCons may be recognized by third party applications to provide further functionality. This includes but is not limited to buying and selling PixelCons or using them in a context beyond ownership of the raw token asset defined in the Core Contract. We are not liable for damages that may be incurred through use of these third party services, including any services that are linked to from the Site. You must read and agree to any third party applications terms of service before interacting with their services.
		<br/><br/>
		<div class="textLarge textBold textDark">The PixelCon Invaders Contracts</div>
		<br/>
		The Service utilizes a single Smart Contract (the “Invaders Contract”) for maintaining the Invaders core state, including ownership and creation of Invaders. Additionally, the Service utilizes a second Smart Contract (the “Bridge Contract”) for transferring ownership of PixelCon Invaders between the main Ethereum blockchain and the Optimistic Ethereum Layer 2 network. You understand and have reviewed the functions defined in both the Invader Contract and Bridge Contract (<a class="light textDark textBold" href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x5536b6aadd29eaf0db112bb28046a5fad3761bd4#code">source code</a>). We do not possess any special control or abilities for interacting with these Smart Contracts beyond the public user functions with the exception of the three admin functions described below.
		<br/>
		<ol type="1">
			<li>We retain the ability to cycle through to a new generation seed in the Bridge Contract for any reason including changing the behavior of creating Invaders.</li>
			<li>We retain the ability to set the metadata URI link in the Invader Contract. This allows Us to provide a reliable reference for third party websites to read PixelCon Invaders metadata. All meta data for a PixelCon Invader can be obtained through secondary functions in the Invader Contract.</li>
			<li>We retain the ability to transfer admin control to another Ethereum address on both the Bridge and Invader Contract.</li>
		</ol>
		You are required to understand that the Invaders Contract utilizes the Optimistic Ethereum Layer 2 rollup network and that the Bridge Contract utilizes the main Ethereum blockchain before interacting with these Smart Contracts. This includes the understanding of the bridging process, during PixelCon Invader creation and general bridging operations, of a PixelCon to the Invaders Contract. Bridging can take multiple days or weeks to complete and We are not responsible for any unforeseen issues while bridging PixelCon Invaders back and forth. You are required to understand that funds will also need to be bridged or aquired separately on your own to pay for Gas fees on the Optimistic Ethereum network. We are not responsible for any confusion or misuse of how Optimistic Ethereum works or how it connects with the main Ethereum blockchain.
		<br/><br/>
		You can freely create or transfer ownership of PixelCon Invaders at your own discretion. To create a PixelCon Invader, you must currently have possesion of eligible PixelCons used as part of the generation process. Not all PixelCons are guaranteed to be able to generate PixelCon Invaders by the time they enter your wallet. If you elect to interact with the Bridge Contract, you understand that those transactions are facilitated through the Ethereum network, which We do not have any special insight or control over. Similarly, if you elect to interact with the Invaders Contract, you understand that those transactions are facilitated through the Optimistic Ethereum Layer 2 network, which We do not have any special insight or control over. This means We are not liable to you or to any third party for claims or damages that result from these interactions.
		<br/><br/>
		Additionally, the Invaders Contract implements the ERC-721 specification for non-fungible tokens. This means that PixelCon Invaders may be recognized by third party applications to provide further functionality. This includes but is not limited to buying and selling PixelCon Invaders or using them in a context beyond ownership of the raw token asset defined in the Invaders Contract. We are not liable for damages that may be incurred through use of these third party services, including any services that are linked to from the Site. You must read and agree to any third party applications terms of service before interacting with their services.
		<br/><br/>
		<div class="textLarge textBold textDark">Disclaimers</div>
		<br/>
		You expressly understand and agree that your use and access to the Service is at your sole risk. The Service is provided “as is” with no warranties of any kind. We will not be liable for any losses you incur as the result of using the Service or Optimistic Ethereum network or Ethereum network in general.
		<br/><br/>
		You accept and understand the risks inherent with blockains. This includes, but is not limited to, volatile changes in the price of digital assets, the requirement of Gas Fees to be paid for every transaction, reliance on an internet connection, an uncertain regulatory environment, technical risks from using Layer 2 technologies, and possible damages or losses from a hard fork.
		<br/><br/>
		Additionally, you accept and understand the risk of interacting with the Service Smart Contracts. This includes, but is not limited to, future identification of potentially breaking bugs that could result in loss of ownership of Pixelcons/Invaders or freezing of future transactions. We are not liable for any damages that result from a fault in the code and are not expected to remedy the situation if it should arise. All code for the Service is open source for you to review <a class="light textDark textBold" href="https://github.com/PixelCons/PixelCons-Contracts">here</a>.
		<br/><br/>
		Finally, We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material we will try to provide at least 30 days notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.
		<br/><br/>
		By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the Service.
